# A Quick Start for Universal Rabbit Hole

In this quick start example, we are going to demonstrate the basic usage of [Navigator](https://github.com/DappioWonderland/navigator) and [Gateway](https://github.com/DappioWonderland/gateway):

- `simple-fetcher`: Fetch / deserialize on-chain data and instantiate pool and farms for 10+ protocols **in less than 50 lines of code**.
- `simple-composer`: Compose a few actions into one operation (in this case, `addLiquidity` and `stake`) for Saber protocol **in less than 50 lines of code**.

### Install dependencies

```bash
$ yarn
```

### Run

```bash
$ yarn start
```
